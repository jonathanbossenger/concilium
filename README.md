# Concilium

Concilium is a locally-installed dashboard for running multiple CLI AI coding
agents side-by-side — Claude Code, Codex, Aider, Gemini, Copilot, Ollama, or
anything else on your `$PATH`. Each agent runs in its own card with a real
[xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) terminal, so both one-shot tools and
interactive REPL-style agents work end-to-end: type, watch ANSI output render
natively, resize, kill, restart.

Pop open a plain shell terminal alongside any session for side-channel
commands. When a card's working directory is a GitHub repo, browse its open
PRs and issues from the same UI — merge, close, mark drafts ready, assign
issues to Copilot, or scaffold a brand-new repo end-to-end (create on GitHub,
clone locally, open a session pre-pointed at it). Sessions, working
directories, and task history persist in SQLite across restarts.

Local-first (`127.0.0.1` by default), no framework, no build step. When exposed
publicly, Concilium auto-switches to admin-auth mode on first external access.
Started, stopped, and installed as a user service Apache-style via
`conciliumctl`.

## Features

- **Card-based session UI** — each card is an independent agent session with
  its own selector, working directory, prompt, output, and (for interactive
  agents) input line. Add cards with **+ New session**, close them when done.
  Card controls are compact icon buttons: 📂 opens the OS folder picker for
  the working directory, ▶ starts the task (turns red while a task is
  running, click to kill), **>_** opens a pop-out terminal card (see
  below), and **⤢** expands a single card to fill the main area with a
  smooth View Transitions animation between states. When the working
  directory resolves to a GitHub repo (via `git remote`), a GitHub
  (octocat) button appears in the card header: clicking it opens a GitHub
  browser card (see below) showing the repo's open pull requests and
  issues. When the cwd is set but the directory is not yet linked to a
  GitHub repo, the same button opens github.com/new to create one. A
  **⧉** clone button duplicates the card with the same agent and working
  directory, then starts the new session immediately. Paths under `$HOME`
  display as `~/...` shorthand in the cwd field; the server expands them
  at launch. Drag a card by its header to reorder it on the grid; the new
  order is persisted to the saved layout. Header controls (select, buttons,
  GitHub button) stay clickable; dragging is disabled while a card is
  expanded.
- **Pop-out terminal cards** — the **>_** button on any session card opens
  an independent shell terminal in a new card (using `$SHELL` on macOS/Linux
  and PowerShell on Windows, inserted right after the triggering card).
  Useful for running side commands —
  `git status`, `ls`, `tail` — in the same working directory as your agent
  without leaving the dashboard. Terminal cards expand and close like any
  other card; closing one ends the shell and drops its history.
- **GitHub browser cards** — clicking the GitHub (octocat) button on any
  session card (when the working directory is a GitHub repository) opens a
  GitHub browser card next to it. The card lists the repo's open pull
  requests and issues (up to 20 each, sorted by last update). Pull request
  rows show the branch name with a copy button, a merge-method selector
  (merge / squash / rebase), a merge button, and a close button; draft PRs
  instead show a "Mark ready for review" button. Issue rows show an "Assign
  to Copilot" button (replaced by a checkmark once assigned) and a close
  button. A **+** button in the GitHub card header opens a **New Issue**
  dialog where you can create an issue with an optional description and
  optionally assign it to the Copilot coding agent. All write actions
  (merge, close, assign, create issue) require a GitHub token configured in
  Settings.
- **Session restore** — the card layout (agent, working directory, last task)
  is persisted server-side in SQLite, so reloading the page or restarting
  the server brings your sessions back and automatically starts each saved
  session with its configured agent and working directory. Closing a card
  permanently removes it (and the tasks it launched) from the saved layout.
- **Two execution modes** — piped stdin for one-shot tools, PTY (via `node-pty`)
  for interactive REPL-style agents
- **Real terminal in the browser** — each card embeds an
  [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) terminal. ANSI/colors/cursor moves render
  natively, keystrokes go straight to the agent's stdin, and a
  `ResizeObserver` + the fit addon drive a resize handshake to the PTY so
  TUIs reflow correctly when you expand a card or resize the window.
- **Live streaming** of stdout/stderr to the browser via Server-Sent Events,
  with automatic reconnect after laptop sleep / network drops so the stream
  resumes without a manual refresh.
- **Persistent history** in SQLite, plus per-task plain-text logs under
  `~/.concilium/logs/`. Closing a card kills any running task and
  deletes that session's tasks + logs.
- **Light / dark / auto theme** — defaults to your OS preference
  (`prefers-color-scheme`); the **Auto** button in the header cycles to
  Light or Dark and persists in `localStorage`.
- **Apache-style lifecycle** — `conciliumctl start | stop | restart | status`,
  with optional install as a launchd or systemd `--user` service
- **PATH-based agent discovery** — scans `$PATH` for known CLIs and lets you
  add them with one click
- **Vanilla web UI** — no framework, no build step, just HTML/CSS/JS
- **Public-server ready** — keep the default loopback-only local mode, or set
  `host: 0.0.0.0` for server deployments. On first external access, Concilium
  requires creating an admin username/password and then signing in.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (tested on 24)
- macOS, Linux, or modern Windows with PowerShell
- A C toolchain only if `node-pty`'s prebuilt binaries aren't available for
  your platform; the current `node-pty` package ships prebuilds for macOS
  arm64/x64 and Windows x64/arm64, while some Linux installs may still build
  from source

External CLIs the server invokes (must be on `$PATH`):

- **`git`** — required. Used to read `origin` / `upstream` remotes when
  detecting the GitHub repo for a card's working directory.
- **`zenity`** — Linux only, optional. Powers the OS folder picker (📂) on
  GNU/Linux desktops. Without it, type or paste paths into the cwd field.
  On macOS the picker uses built-in `osascript`; on Windows it uses built-in
  `powershell`.

## Quickstart

If you just want to get going quickly:

1. Clone and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:jonathanbossenger/concilium.git
   cd concilium
   npm install
   ```
2. Make `conciliumctl` available in your shell:
   ```bash
   npm link
   ```
3. Start Concilium:
   ```bash
   conciliumctl start
   ```
4. Open <http://127.0.0.1:7878>, create a session, and run your first prompt.

For full install, setup, and usage details, see the documentation section below.

## Concilium user documentation

### Install

For installation and first-run setup, see:

- [docs/install-and-first-time-setup.md](docs/install-and-first-time-setup.md)
- [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for the full user docs index

### Usage

For day-to-day use, see:

- [docs/using-concilium.md](docs/using-concilium.md)
- [docs/configuring-agents.md](docs/configuring-agents.md)
- [docs/github-token.md](docs/github-token.md)
- [docs/uninstalling.md](docs/uninstalling.md)

## Configuration

State lives entirely under `~/.concilium/`:

```
~/.concilium/
├── config.yaml      # port + optional githubToken + agent list
├── tasks.db         # SQLite history + saved card layout
├── logs/<id>.log    # per-task plain-text output log
├── server.log       # the server's own stdout/stderr
└── run.pid          # standalone-mode PID file
```

A minimal `config.yaml`:

```yaml
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 7878
publicServer: false
adminUser: ""
adminPasswordHash: ""
adminPasswordSalt: ""
authSecret: ""
githubToken: ""
agents:
  - id: claude
    name: Claude Code
    command: claude
    interactive: false
  - id: aider
    name: Aider
    command: aider
    interactive: true
    args: ["--no-pretty"]
```

`interactive: false` → stdin is piped in, then closed (one-shot).
`interactive: true` → spawned under a PTY; stays alive for follow-up input.
`githubToken` is optional and used for authenticated GitHub API requests.

Edits via the UI take effect immediately. Editing the YAML by hand requires
a restart (`conciliumctl restart`).
`config.yaml` may contain a secret token — keep it readable only by your user.
